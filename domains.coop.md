Domains.coop have announced [The Termination of all Domains.coop Email and Hosting services](https://domains.coop/support/).

Co-operative Technologists (CoTech) represents technology co-operatives across the UK. It has 46 coops in membership.

Four CoTech members are able to offer fast provisioning of email and hosting to Domains.coop clients.

Domain name registrations can remain with Domains.coop, or if clients wish, the CoTech members can transfer them to their own <code>.coop</code> reseller accounts in order that clients only have one organisation to invoice for all their services.

They are, in alphabetical order:

* [GreenNet](/co-op/greennet)
* [MediaBlaze Hosts](/co-op/mediablaze-hosts)
* [Netuxo](/co-op/netuxo)
* [Webarchitects](/co-op/webarchitects)

All are experienced tech businesses who not only will be able to provide a wide range of other services such as web design. Whatâ€™s more, they understand cooperatives: because they are cooperatives.
