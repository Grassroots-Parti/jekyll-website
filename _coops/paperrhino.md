Paper Rhino is a creative co-op specialising in illustration, art, typography, animation and design. We are passionate about our disciplines and equally as passionate about working in a socially responsible way. We started Paper Rhino in 2011 so we could provide affordable, fair services to ethically-conscious organisations, small companies, NGO’s and charities. We are a highly creative team that are bordering on the obsessive when it comes to our individual skills. We are passionate in our belief that we can make the world a more beautiful place. Please take a few moments to have a look at our work and if you like what you see, get in touch – we’d love to hear from you.
