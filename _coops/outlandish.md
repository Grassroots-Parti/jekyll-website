Outlandish is made up of around 20 collaborators and co-owners who love humour, quality code, and apps that challenge the status quo.

We build digital applications and websites for companies, charities and universities that make their lives easier and help them to discover and communicate new insights from their data. We are a worker co-operative and invest all surpluses into projects that help achieve our goals.

We specialise in web applications and websites that make large amounts of data easy to manage through beautiful interfaces but we turn our hands to all sorts. We love ambitious and innovative projects and weâ€™ve helped our clients manage their money, build social movements, publicise research and engage people with poetry.
